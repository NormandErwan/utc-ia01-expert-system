We created an [expert system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system) in Common Lisp. Given parameters, the program answers one question: Would it be possible to survive on that deserted island?. The expert system is 0+ order, and has two inference engine: one using the forward chaining, the other using the backward chaining.
